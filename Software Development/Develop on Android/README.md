- [Linking Activities](https://developer.android.com/training/basics/firstapp/starting-activity.html)
- [ActionBar](https://developer.android.com/training/appbar/index.html)
* Important Views in Android - More complicated, but extremely useful Views
- [RecyclerView](https://www.binpress.com/tutorial/android-l-recyclerview-and-cardview-tutorial/156) (Lists)
- [ViewPager](https://developer.android.com/training/implementing-navigation/lateral.html
              )(Tabbed Layouts)
- [CoordinatorLayout](http://saulmm.github.io/mastering-coordinator)(Fancy Animation)
* [Networking](http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/JavaLibrary-OkHttp/article.html)
* [Events and States](https://developer.android.com/training/basics/firstapp/building-ui.html) - Handling user text input, touches to the screen and applies conditional logic and delays to implement loading states, error states, and conditional navigation.
* Advanced Navigation - More complex navigation like Drawers, Fragments, and custom tab bars.
- [Fragments](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/fragments.html) (A pre-req for everything below)
- [Drawers](https://developer.android.com/training/implementing-navigation/nav-drawer.html)
- [Custom Tab Bar](https://developer.android.com/training/implementing-navigation/lateral.html) (same as ViewPager above)
