Welcome to the open-source Zahn Innovation Center Startup Kit! Our goal is to crowdsourced a starter kit that will speed up the software/hardware development process for startup companies. [You can provide your feedback or request more information here](https://goo.gl/forms/3YtpUofXxHWQKkS42)

### Stay on top of the Game
* Sketch app is the new standard when creating wireframes for web and mobiles apps. The only downside is it only works on a Mac. 30- day trial can be found [here](https://www.sketchapp.com/), full version costs $99.
* For free app icon sets and templates, visit: [Sketch](https://www.sketchappsources.com/)
* Curated list of blockchain and general cryptocurrency resources: [Blockchain-stuff](https://github.com/Xel/Blockchain-stuff)
* NASA Releases Software Catalog, Granting the Public [Free Access to Technologies for Earthly Applications](https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-releases-software-catalog-granting-the-public-free-access-to-technologies-for)
* 37 experts collaborated to create [materials useful to all the aspiring entrepreneurs](http://www.endureproject.eu/materials/) who want to build resilient businesses. According to the KBS framework developed by Santoro and Bifulco (2005), such materials have been split into 3 categories: Knowledge, Business, and Social. Within each category, you can find free resources (such as paragraphs, case studies, and videos) concerning topics related to each of the above-mentioned aspects.
* [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) is an advanced, feature-packed, multi-platform 2D and 3D open source game engine
