App Fundamentals
This week we'll dive right in and build a Flicks app that showcases movie reviews. You'll start on it by yourself with a couple video walkthroughs on Sunday, work on it some more in class with a partner on Monday, and then finish the rest on your own at home. Your completed app is due February 14th at 11:59pm.

Helpful Resources for the Week:
Understanding Swift => This guide covers a majority of the Swift topics you'll need to know for the class. For the first week, check out the sections on arrays, and dictionaries, and working with JSON.
Xcode Project Basics => As you start building apps, it's helpful to know about all different types of files that you'll be working with inside of an Xcode Project.
Sunday
Please start by completing the setup section of the assignment.
Then watch the following videos and follow along with the assignment quickstarts:
Assignment Quickstart #1 - Basic Table View Setup (8 minutes)

When you are finished with the above quickstart videos please push the code you've completed to a new GitHub repository. At this point, you should have a good feel for the main topics of this week. In class, we will continue to work from this point to get farther in the assignment.
Monday
You'll start off class with a discussion of the topics we introduced this week. Then you'll have some time to work on your assignment with a partner, starting with watching the following assignment quickstart video:
